                <p>Hi there! My name is Jacob Kerr. I am a freshman at Cornell University's College of Engineering studying computer science.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I am interested in software engineering and development of all kinds. I've worked in web app design and implementation at various hackathons I've competed (and won) at. I've developed various command line interface programs in Java and OCaml in my various CS classes at Cornell. I've developed full GUI applications, such as an animal simulation, for these classes as well.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I consider myself a full stack engineer with more of an emphasis on backend. I'm open to any internship or job opportunities you might want throw my way. You can contact me at jck268@cornell.edu. If you are looking for more information, consider checking out my links <a href="../links/links.html" id="text-link">here.</a></p>
