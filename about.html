		    <p>Hi there! I'm JakeJack! I am a streamer on Twitch, where I stream games as well as work on smaller projects. I love playing video games every second I can get and often share my experiences on stream. Come stop by to say hi one day.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I also work as a moderator and administrator for many streamers on their Twitch channels and Discord servers. If you need any help managing anything in your Twitch life, I'm the guy to go to.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I also work as a part-time independent contractor who builds and maintains professional-looking websites like this one. Hit me up if you ever need some work done.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> I am ALSO an avid full-stack developer who specializes in front-end development, algorithms, and game dev.</p>
